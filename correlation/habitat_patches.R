## script to extract number of patches from 21999 rasters generated in the habitat
# amount model and to correlate proportion of habitat and number of patches 
# 
## to run this script will be need to download the folder with all raster, which
## is heavier than github allowed
## to download the folder with the rasters go to: https://1drv.ms/f/s!AlTrDSRCiM2NiMVesKAO6ztlOvWoxw?e=35meUu
