* scripts folder:
    - simulations: to run and save model simulations on NetLogo
    - sensitivity_analysis: to run sensitivity analysis using the files created in the script "simulations"
    - model_fitting: to evaluate the shape of the response curve between inputs and outputs considering candidate models
    - graph: to create the figures

* netlogo_code folder:
    - _original: code created for the manuscript
    - _simulations: code adapted to run simulations using R and do sensitivity analysis

* results folder:
    - files _simulations.rds = netlogo objects with all simulations information
    - files _output.csv = backup with results from files ".rds"
    - file model_fitting = model selection information

* figures folder:
    figures used in the manuscript and in the supplementary material

* correlation folder:
    script and results of correlation between number of patches and proportion of habitat
